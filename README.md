Learnt from YouTube and coded along the way.
Had to recheck so many things, was a huge upskill in my life you can say.

Improvements-

1. Introduction of AI agent/ i.e.., an algorithm for moving the paddle 2-
This approach predicts the future position of the ball along the y-axis based on its current trajectory and adjusts the AI paddle's position to intercept that predicted position. It takes into account the time it will take for the ball to reach the AI paddle's x position and uses that information to estimate the future y position of the ball. The AI paddle then moves towards that predicted position, aiming to intercept the ball and bounce it back towards the opponent.
Also the AI/algorithm calculates the predicted position of the ball based on its current trajectory. It then adjusts the AI paddle's movement to intercept the ball at its predicted position. This approach makes the AI agent more efficient and capable of reacting to the ball's movement in a smoother and more natural way. Adjusting the speed parameter can fine-tune the responsiveness of the AI paddle to the ball's movements.

2.Connecting to an mySQL database with the JDBC drivers and performing relevant queries.
