AI agent (Paddle 2) prediction criteria-
This approach predicts the future position of the ball along the y-axis based on its current trajectory and adjusts the AI paddle's position to intercept that predicted position. It takes into account the time it will take for the ball to reach the AI paddle's x position and uses that information to estimate the future y position of the ball. The AI paddle then moves towards that predicted position, aiming to intercept the ball and bounce it back towards the opponent.
